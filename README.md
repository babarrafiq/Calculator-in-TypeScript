# calculator-in-TypeScript
I made a basic Calculator in TypeScript that takes two numbers as input from the user and then it performs basic operations like + ,- ,* , / on those numbers and shows result as output.  

## Usage/Examples

```
Please enter your first number:  50
Please enter your second number:  50
Which operation do you want to perform: +    
The result of first and second numbers are: 100
```


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/babarrafiq/calculator-in-TypeScript.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```
